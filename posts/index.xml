      <description>Go does not have a set datastructure. A common pattern is to mimick a set by using a map where the key is the &amp;ldquo;set entry&amp;rdquo; and the value does not matter.
In a discussion on hackernews recently, we discussed two similar implementations for a set, namely:
 map[type]bool map[type]struct{}  They are almost identical, and whilst I really like the first definition it was brought to my attention that the second might be favourable for performance reasons.</description>

      <description>Recently I have read The Psychology of Computer Programming, written by Gerald M. Weinberg. The book was originally published in 1971, though it got republished in 2011. (I read it on a kindle paperwhite and it looked great! So don&amp;rsquo;t worry about the age of the book in case you fear it won&amp;rsquo;t look good in e-book format).
Even though the book was written in a time before the public internet, Java, Javascript, smartphones and many more things we take for granted today, a lot of the content still rings true today.</description>

      <description>The past After two years of not having written anything for my blog, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided it was time to start anew.
My old blog was created using WordPress in mid-2011, it was the first blog that was hosted on a machine a friend and I rented rather than blogspot. Whilst the blog served it&amp;rsquo;s purpose and was home to 7 years of content-creation, I felt like it was time to change things up.</description>
