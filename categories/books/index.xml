      <description>If there was one book this year that it was hard to avoid hearing about, it was &amp;ldquo;Software Engineering at Google&amp;rdquo;. As such, it was only a matter of time before I jumped on the bandwagon and decided to give it a read, but I&amp;rsquo;m happy I finally did!
I track my highlights and notes through my kindle / goodreads, and ended up with about 80 of them. In this blogpost, I&amp;rsquo;ll just go over some of what that I thought stood out in the book in one way or another.</description>
