    <h1 id="the-past">The past</h1>
<p>After two years of not having written anything for my blog, I&rsquo;ve decided it was time to start anew.</p>
<p>My old blog was created using WordPress in mid-2011, it was the first blog that was hosted on a
machine a friend and I rented rather than blogspot. Whilst the blog served it&rsquo;s purpose and was home to 7 years
of content-creation, I felt like it was time to change things up.</p>
<p>My last entry was made in 2017. This is, as of this time, about 2 years ago. The lack of content is
mostly due to a lack of time. One of my hopes for this year is to produce at least some valuable
content again.</p>
<p>This blog also serves as a fresh start.
It might be something that happens to all of us who&rsquo;ve been blogging for close to a decade, but reading upon old posts can be quite embarrasing!<br>
There is some valuable content on there, so for the time being it&rsquo;ll still be available on the usual
place. It gets around ~150 views a month which is not terrible for an inactive blog. :)</p>
<p>Some technical info about the old blog that I wanted to get rid off for a long time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Powered by WordPress</li>
<li>No version control</li>
<li>Edit posts with WP-Admin</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-present">The present</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed writing technical content, and whilst studying I had plenty of time to do so.
The past few years, adjusting to a new routine has made writing blogs low on the priority list.
Currently I have a full-time job, in addition to being happily married. But I&rsquo;ll try to keep this
one more or less active. :).</p>
<p>One thing that has at least gotten more interesting is the technology behind this blog! It&rsquo;s created
with Hugo, a Go Static Website generator. And I&rsquo;ve put it up on Github, which helps with the version
control issues!</p>
<p>My goal is to have at least a few posts out this year. :D</p>
