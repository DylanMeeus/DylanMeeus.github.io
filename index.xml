      <description>The past After two years of not having written anything for my blog, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided it was time to start anew.
My old blog was created using WordPress in mid-2011, it was the first blog that was hosted on a machine a friend and I rented rather than blogspot. Whilst the blog served it&amp;rsquo;s purpose and was home to 7 years of content-creation, I felt like it was time to change things up.</description>
