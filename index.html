        In a previous post we have looked at how we can turn a mono audio signal into a stereo signal with an applied pan. One drawback of this program was that it was not possible to change the pan throughout the track, meaning that once a pan had been selected it would be applied to the entire song.
Now that we have implemented breakpoints, we can start looking at changing the pan (and other properties) throughout the duration of the track.

        Audio Breakpoints To clear up a potential mistake, this blogpost is about breakpoints for audio files, not the ones we use for debugging code ;-). A breakpoint file forms the basis for what is often called &lsquo;envelopes&rsquo; or &lsquo;automation tracks&rsquo; in DAWs.
They are simple files that contain pairs of timestamp:value data. With this simple structure, they allow us to specify what certain properties of the sound file should look like at various points in time.

        In the previous post we have written code to change the amplitude of wave files.
Now we&rsquo;ll take a look at how we can turn a mono wave file into a stereo wave file with optional panning, and explore how this is represented internally by the WAVE file format.
Channels The raw audio data inside a WAVE file consists of multiple frames. For now, we have called them &lsquo;samples&rsquo; although that is strictly speaking not entirely correct.

        In the previous post we have written code to read and write WAVE files. So now it&rsquo;s time to start using this functionality to actually manipulate some sound. The goal of this post is simple, we want to change the amplitude of a given .wave file.
For this, I will import the library we wrote in Part 2.
The code for this post is also on Github.
Changing amplitudes The program to change the amplitude will require three inputs:

        In our last post we have looked at how we can create a simple binary sound file. By creating a sine wave with exponential decay, we can get the effect of a single note playing.
It&rsquo;s good to know what these types of files look like. In the real world however you&rsquo;ll usually encounter files that are a bit more complex. One of the common formats to find audio in is the WAVE file format, normally denoted with the extension .

        Audio from scratch: generating sound In my &lsquo;audio from scratch&rsquo; series we will take a look at various ways in which we can manipulate audio data with Go. We&rsquo;ll look at the anatomy of a wave file, how to apply stereo panning, converting mono files to stereo, how to work with breakpoint files through linear interpolation, etc.
But, in this post we’ll be using Go to create sound from scratch in binary format.

        What is Hasgo? Hasgo is a code generator that can be used to generate functions that work on slices. We don&rsquo;t have generics in Go, which I think is a good thing, but we can generate code with go:generate to work on different types.
Hasgo does just this, we write functions and then say for which types we want to generate these functions. For our Ints, the generation looks like this:

        Go does not have a set datastructure. A common pattern is to mimick a set by using a map where the key is the &ldquo;set entry&rdquo; and the value does not matter.
In a discussion on hackernews recently, we discussed two similar implementations for a set, namely:
 map[type]bool map[type]struct{}  They are almost identical, and whilst I really like the first definition it was brought to my attention that the second might be favourable for performance reasons.

        Recently I have read The Psychology of Computer Programming, written by Gerald M. Weinberg. The book was originally published in 1971, though it got republished in 2011. (I read it on a kindle paperwhite and it looked great! So don&rsquo;t worry about the age of the book in case you fear it won&rsquo;t look good in e-book format).
Even though the book was written in a time before the public internet, Java, Javascript, smartphones and many more things we take for granted today, a lot of the content still rings true today.

        The past After two years of not having written anything for my blog, I&rsquo;ve decided it was time to start anew.
My old blog was created using WordPress in mid-2011, it was the first blog that was hosted on a machine a friend and I rented rather than blogspot. Whilst the blog served it&rsquo;s purpose and was home to 7 years of content-creation, I felt like it was time to change things up.
